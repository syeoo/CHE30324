Specify the “Molecular Energy” option to Orga and the def2-SVP basis set. Calculate and plot out total molecular energy vs. bond distance in increments of 0.05 Å about your guessed minimum, including enough points to encompass the actual minimum. (You will find it convenient to subtract off the individual atom energies from the molecular total energy and to convert to more convenient units, like eV or kJ/mol.)
